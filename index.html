		<p class="lead">The flower below includes nine concepts which describe learning processes hat you can use to improve your learning. Hover over each one to get a description and example. Your teacher will want to see evidence of them in your reflection.</p>
          <p id="acceptance"><a href="#" title="Acceptance" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-content="<b>Describing</b>: Sets the context or recall what was done during the project. No evaluation or personal opinion provided. It is a straightforward description that provides a mental image to the reader with regards to what is discussed. <br/> <b>Awareness</b>: Refers more tool or theories covered in the course and it demonstrates that the learner has heard of them. On their own, these quotes usually do not relate to the project as illustrated by the example on the right-hand side." data-html="true">Acceptance</a></p>
		  <p id="differentiation"><a href="#" title="Differentiation" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-content="<b>Discerning</b>: The learner can distinguish or discriminate between different key aspects of the project especially if those are not obvious. <br/> <b>Observing</b>: This is very similar to Discerning but this time, it demonstrates that the learner has noticed aspects of the project that deviate from the norm. <br/> <b>Questioning</b>: Although the data in this development pattern could easily fit in other categories as well, it always triggered by an explicit question leading to some kind of analysis. The learner demonstrates that he/she can ask pertinent queries driving to the creation of new meaning which can be used for different purposes such as opinion forming, problem-solving or application of theories." data-html="true">Differentiation</a></p>
		  <p id="action"><a href="#" title="Action" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-content="<b>Implementing</b>: Provides a description of a specific aspect of the project that was implemented as well as an explanation with regards to why it was implemented. This demonstrates project's progress and learner's understanding of action. <br/> <b>Problem Solving</b>: This is initiated by the recognition of an issue and it either explains how the issue has been dealt with during the project or it demonstrates that the learner has thought of a mean of effectively dealing with the problem in the future. <br/> <b>Interacting</b>: This refers to inter-persons communication in relation to proect's progress." data-html="true">Action</a></p>
		  <p id="comprehension"><a href="#" title="Comprehension" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-content="<b>Analysing</b>: This refers to the creation of new meaning with the aim of understanding or clarifying matters under discussion. <br/> <b>Comparing</b>: This illustrates evidence of creation of new meaning based on comparison made, for instance between methods used, tool found, experiences ect <br/> <b>Evalution</b>:This provides evidence of creation of new meaning based on evaluation of data or practice but not from one's opinion. The learner estimates similarities or dissimilarities between aspects of the project or experiences.<br/> <b>Applying</b>: This development pattern demonstrates that the learner has most or less understood a process/theory and is able to use it or refer to it in the context of the project. Although this pattern might not evidence as much 'creation of new meaning' than other patterns belonging to this category, it greatly demonstrates the comprehension of key tools and theories relevant to the project." data-html="true">Comprehension</a></p>
		  <p id="generalisation"><a href="#" title="Generalisation" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-content="<b>Synthesising</b>: The 'Synthesising' development pattern shows that the learner can extract key lessons learnt from the practice and possibly apply them to future projects or stages of this project. Those lessons learnt are usually extracted from the whole project meaning that they are more generic than for the development pattern 'Drawing conclusions'. <br/> <b>Drawing conclusions</b>: The 'Drawing conclusions' pattern is the extraction of lessons learnt from the practice but extracted from specific aspects of the project. <br/> <b>Theorising</b>: Theorising shows that the learner is able to extract rules and formulate suggestions from project experience." data-html="true">Generalisation</a></p>
		  <p id="projection"><a href="#" title="Projection" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-content="<b>Anticipating</b>: This development pattern shows that the learner is able to foresee what could have happened during the project or he/she can predict outcomes of actions or decisions. <br/> <b> Extrapolating</b>: The leader shows that he/she can extend the application of a known method or conclusions to an unknown situation by assuming that its application will deliver the same trends or benefits. He/she can predict something by extrapolation of known data. </br> <b>Linking to prior experience</b>: This pattern enables learners to draw from their past experiences to predict or plan for the future. It demonstrates that the learner is assimilating past lessons learnt to avoid future mistakes or make a process more efficient. </br> <b>Assuming</b>: The 'Assuming' development pattern demonstrates that the learner can make a supposition that something is true without any proof. The learner can also admit that he/she wrongly assumed something. </br> <b>Planning</b>: This pattern illustrates that the learner can arrange key aspects of a project in advance, and understands the value of doing so." data-html="true">Projection</a></p>
		  <p id="opinion"><a href="#" title="Opinion" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-content="<b>Judging</b>: This Pattern confirms that the learner can draw personal opinions from his/her own experiences and therefore learn from them. <br/> <b>Interpreting</b>: The 'Interpreting' pattern demonstrates that the learner can either interpret data from the literature in order to put it into practice in the project (**) or interpret the practice with the aim to ground it in the literature often to justify good practice(*)." data-html="true">Opinion</a></p>
		  <p id="sensing"><a href="#" title="Sensing" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-content="<b>Feeling</b>: The 'Feeling' pattern shows that the learner can recognise inner emotions experienced during the practice and he/she is usually able to offer an explanation for its cause. </br> <b>Sensing</b>: The development pattern 'Sensing' is a way for the learner to express awareness of something without being able to define exactly the causes." data-html="true">Sensing</a></p>
		  <p id="proving"><a href="#" title="Proving" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-content= "<b>Evidencing</b>: This gives the learner the opportunity to use a body of facts or information, usually from the literature, to indicate whether his/her belief or proposition is true or valid. <br /> <b>Illustrating</b>: Illustrating enables the learner to provide explain and make something clear -and more specific- by using examples usually drawn from practice. <br /><b>Justifying</b>: This development pattern helps the learner to find reasons and justifications to prove that practice or actions were (or not) right and reasonable." data-html="true" >Proving</a></p>
